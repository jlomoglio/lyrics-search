# React Lyric Finder

This is a demo project I created using React 16.8 and the Context-API.

Lyrics are pulled from the Music Match API.

It became very clear to me in this simple demo that the Context API is only useful in a very small
application and would not be viable for an enterprise application.

So now it comes down to which is truly a better solution: Redux or MobX.
